# linguistic-probes
This is a university lab work for my Machine Learning 1 course.

The goal was to find out if the information necessary to predict if the agreement of the past participle with the direct object in French is encoded in the neural network
representation of the direct object. For this, we trained a linguistic probe to predict the agreement using the sklearn library for l1-regularization.

The annotated corpus was provided by the teacher, I have not added it to this github repository.

Instructions for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/linguistic-probes/blob/main/instructions_l1.pdf) and my final report [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/linguistic-probes/blob/main/report_l1_regularization.pdf).
          
I submitted this work in December 2021.
