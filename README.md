# linguistic-probes
This is a university lab work for my Machine Learning 1 course.

The goal was to find out if the information necessary to predict if the agreement of the past participle with the direct object in French is encoded in the neural network
representation of the direct object. For this, we trained a linguistic probe to predict the agreement using l1-regularization.

I submitted this work in December 2021.
